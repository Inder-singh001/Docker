# Docker
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host.
