# Docker
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your host machine so you can deliver software quickly.Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host.

## What is container
A **Container** is a box that process isolated environment on your machine from all other processes on the host machine.It is a platform where you can run the images.
- You can create, start, stop, move or delete a container using Docker.
- You can create many containers and run many software isolated on your machine from your host machine.
- It can be run on local machines, virtual machines or deployed to the cloud and is poratble i.e can rum on any OS.
